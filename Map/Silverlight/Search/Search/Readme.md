##Search##
The RadMap control allows you to implement search functionality, that will allow the user to search for a specific location on the map. The search is performed by using Search Providers, which communicate with the respective Map Provider's services. With this feature available you are able to build an UI that allows the user to input search criteria and execute a search.

To see and run the example, please use the 'Open in VS' button and execute the project inside Visual Studio.
