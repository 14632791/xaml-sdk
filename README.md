========

The __XAML SDK__ is an easy-to-use infrastructure with 600+ developer focused examples for most of the Telerik WPF and Silverlight controls. 

You can also install the __Telerik SDK SAMPLE BROWSER for [WPF](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/13-11-04/introducing-wpf-sdk-samples-browser) and [Silverlight](http://blogs.telerik.com/xamlteam/posts/14-03-10/silverlight-available-in-the-sdk-samples-browser)__ from [here](http://demos.telerik.com/xaml-sdkbrowser/). It provides a friendly way of browsing through the repository, automatically connects to GitHub and updates the examples and gives you the ability to directly run them or see their code.

The examples for each of the components in the suite are listed in [the documentation](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/sdk-examples.html) along with a short description.
